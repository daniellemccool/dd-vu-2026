title: Separate upstream props from D3I-custom props
---

## <a name="question"></a> Context and Problem Statement

The fork needs Python prop types not present in upstream feldspar: PropsUIPromptQuestionnaire, PropsUIPromptFileInputMultiple, and others. Should these be added to props.py (which mirrors Eyra's types) or kept in a separate file?

## <a name="options"></a> Considered Options
1. <a name="option-1"></a> Add all prop types to props.py regardless of origin
2. <a name="option-2"></a> Separate: props.py mirrors upstream, d3i_props.py contains additions
3. <a name="option-3"></a> Separate package for D3I prop types

## <a name="criteria"></a> Decision Drivers

* Upstream merges into `props.py` should be clean — D3I additions would create merge conflicts on every upstream sync
* The underscore convention and two-file structure make D3I additions immediately visible to anyone reading the codebase
* `props.py` mirrors Eyra's TypeScript props types; adding D3I types would make the mirror relationship opaque

## <a name="outcome"></a> Decision Outcome
We decided for [Option 2](#option-2) because: Keeping props.py as a clean mirror of upstream Eyra types means upstream merges into that file are clean and the diff clearly shows what D3I has added; d3i_props.py makes D3I additions explicit and auditable.

### Consequences

* Good: `props.py` can be updated by dropping in Eyra's upstream version — no conflict resolution needed
* Good: Any reviewer can see exactly what D3I has added to the type system by looking at `d3i_props.py` alone
* Bad: Platform code and helpers must import from two files (`props` and `d3i_props`) rather than one

### Confirmation

Code review: any new Python prop type that is D3I-specific (not present in upstream `eyra/feldspar`) and appears in `props.py` is a violation. The fix: move it to `d3i_props.py`.
